# Scan

## SCAN[¶](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/nautilus/ceph-volume/lvm/scan/#scan)

This sub-command will allow to discover Ceph volumes previously setup by the tool by looking into the system’s logical volumes and their tags.

As part of the [prepare](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/nautilus/ceph-volume/lvm/prepare/#ceph-volume-lvm-prepare) process, the logical volumes are assigned a few tags with important pieces of information.

Note 

This sub-command is not yet implemented
