## CONFIGURATION

Each Ceph process, daemon or utility draws its configuration from several sources on startup, include a local configuration, the monitors, the command line, or environment variables. Configuration options may be set globally such that they apply to all daemons, to all daemons or services of a particular type, or only to a specific daemon, process, or client.
